Packet analyser is a computer program that intercepts and log traffic that passes over a computer network or part of a network. Packet filtering is used to control network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or halt based on the source and destination Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, protocols and ports.
